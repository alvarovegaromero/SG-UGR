Lab ork of the subject "Graphic Systems" (SG) - Degree in Computer Engineering 2021-2022

The first part of the course consisted of a series of basic exercises.
The second part was based on a more complex project. The project was to make a Snake3D together with my partner David Correa Rodr√≠guez (@davidcr01). 
In order to play the game, you can do it by downloading the files and opening a server with Python or in the following link: https://alvarovegaromero.github.io/Snake3D/
